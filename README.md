# Document Ink  
Enterprise Knowledge Integrity & Freshness Platform  
Enabling Trusted, Standardized, and Continuously‑Updated IT Documentation

---

## Overview

Document Ink is an enterprise-grade platform designed to unify, standardize, and continuously validate operational documentation across multiple systems including SharePoint, ServiceNow, vendor documentation, and custom sources.  

Modern IT organizations rely on procedures, runbooks, and instructions that quickly become outdated, inconsistent, or risky to execute. Document Ink solves this by creating a single source of truth with:

- **Unified Documentation Standard (UDS)**
- **Continuous Freshness Engine**
- **Trust & Risk Scoring**
- **Automated Content Validation**
- **Multi‑cloud Connectors**
- **Search optimized for IT operations**
- **Visual, OCR‑ready, video‑aware documentation blocks**

Built for enterprise IT operations, cloud teams, support functions, and compliance teams seeking reliability, auditability, and rapid knowledge validation.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Unified Documentation Standard (UDS)
Every ingested document is transformed into a structured, step-by-step format with:
- Prerequisites and access requirements  
- Safe‑execution steps  
- Validation/rollback  
- Troubleshooting  
- Compliance metadata  
- Evidence blocks (screenshots, logs, transcripts)

### 2. Trust & Freshness Engine
Document Ink continuously evaluates:
- Document drift  
- Link and asset health  
- Vendor documentation changes  
- Incident-based relevance  
- Outdated technical content  
- Missing or incomplete steps  
- Evidence quality

This produces a **trust score** and **freshness score** that guide operators toward safe, reliable content.

### 3. Enterprise Connectors (Phase 1)
- **SharePoint** (documents, libraries, pages)  
- **ServiceNow** (knowledge, incidents, changes)  
- **Vendor Web Content** (release notes, advisories, docs)

### 4. Multimodal Enrichment (v1.1+)
- OCR text extraction for screenshots & images  
- TTS “audio runbooks” for hands‑free execution  
- Smart video replacement when embedded media becomes unavailable  

### 5. Enterprise Security & Governance
- OIDC/SAML identity integration (Entra ID first)  
- Role-based access control  
- Full audit logs  
- Tenant isolation  
- SOC2 / ISO27001 aligned design  
- GDPR-ready content lifecycle controls
